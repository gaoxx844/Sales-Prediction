# Sales-Prediction
In this case, I tried to use numeric prediction techniques, including linear regression, k-NN, regression tree,
SVM regreesion and Neural Network and ensembling models to predict if different consumers made a purchase in 
response to a test mailing of a certain catalog and how much will each consumer spent. 

The output has two possible outcome variables: Purchase (0/1 value: whether or not the purchase was made) and
Spending (numeric value: amount spent)
